Sumthn.fun Executive Summary
Overview “Sumthn.fun” is a decentralized, player‑versus‑player gaming platform built on a gas efficient evm L2 blockchain. It leverages smart contracts for secure escrow management and automated payouts while offering an immersive, cross‑device user experience (desktop, iPad, and mobile). Players choose from reskinned classics like Tetris, Temple Run, and Bubble Bop and use a Tinder‑style matching system to challenge opponents. Each game session runs over private WebSockets with spectator “read‑only” rooms and integrated chat to foster community interaction.
Platform Walkthrough
Dashboard & Matching: Upon login, users see a clean, responsive dashboard to select a game and view available challenges. A Tinder‑like interface enables users to swipe through opponents and prop bet offers.

Game Sessions: Once matched, users enter a secure game lobby. The session is hosted on private WebSockets, ensuring real‑time gameplay and score tracking. Game results trigger off‑chain verification and on‑chain payout via pre‑configured smart contracts deployed by a CREATE2 factory.

Leaderboards & Tournaments: Individual game leaderboards and a global ranking system encourage competitive play. Weekly “Tournament of Champions” invites top‑20 players for a free tournament with crypto prize pools.

Blockchain & Security: Every game uses a standard betting and payout format irrespective of in‑game logic. Robust on‑chain cheat detection automatically flags offenders, blacklisting them and reallocating funds to community raffles.

Social Integration: The platform integrates social media tools for sharing achievements, live chat during matches, and community forums to enhance engagement and build a vibrant arcade community.
