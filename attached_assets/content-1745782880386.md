# Alternative frontend origins

Intermediate

Authentication

If your application has reached the stage where you want to change domain names, and you have been authenticating with Internet Identity (II), you will want to make sure that your users can seamlessly keep the same principals they have already been using. To support this functionality, you can configure your application for alternative frontend origins using this guide.

You may need this guide if you are doing any of the following:

- Moving from `<canister-id>.icp0.io` to a [custom domain](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/building-apps/frontends/custom-domains/using-custom-domains/).
- Asking users to log in at `/login` instead of `/`.
- Supporting users using `raw.icp0.io`.
- Configuring multiple apps in your organization to use the same principals.

## Constraints [​](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/building-apps/authentication/alternative-origins\#constraints "Direct link to Constraints")

Currently, a maximum of **10** alternative origins can be listed.

Internet Identity will only follow this specification when the origin configuring these alternatives is hosted on a canister using **certified assets**.

For more information, see the [Internet Identity specification](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/references/ii-spec/#alternative-frontend-origins).

## Configuring alternative origins [​](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/building-apps/authentication/alternative-origins\#configuring-alternative-origins "Direct link to Configuring alternative origins")

For this example, you will have two domains, **A** and **B**. **A** will be the canonical origin, and **B** will be the alternative domain. To help illustrate this model, consider this website, which is hosted both at `https://yourcustomdomain.com` and `https://www.yourdomain.com`.

In this example, **A** would be `https://yourcustomdomain.com`.

For production use cases, domain **A** would use a domain on ICP, such as `ic0.app` or `icp0.io`.

**B** would be the alternative origin, or `https://www.yourdomain.com`.

### Listing origins [​](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/building-apps/authentication/alternative-origins\#listing-origins "Direct link to Listing origins")

On origin **A**, you will need to provide a file that tells Internet Identity that **B** is a valid alternative origin. You'll be placing the config files in the `src/assets` directory of your frontend canister. If your frontend canister is currently configured to deploy assets from a `dist` folder, make sure to update the `sources` for your canister to include both:

dfx.json

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
"source": [\
    "dist",\
    "src/assets"\
]

```

Inside of `src/assets`, create a `.well-known` folder, and add a file named `ii-alternative-origins.`

The file needs to be exactly named `ii-alternative-origins`, with no file extension. The content inside will be formatted as JSON, but the file should not end with `.json`.

Inside of the file, list your alternative origin for **B**. It will look something like this:

src/assets/.well-known/ii-alternative-origins

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
{
  "alternativeOrigins": ["https://internetcomputer.org"]
}

```

Make sure that you remove any trailing slash or query parameters from the origin.

Now, your project should look something like this:

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
├── dfx.json
├── src
│   ├── assets
│   │   ├── .well-known
│   │   │   └── ii-alternative-origins

```

### Configuring your frontend canister [​](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/building-apps/authentication/alternative-origins\#configuring-your-frontend-canister "Direct link to Configuring your frontend canister")

Because the dot syntax in `.well-known` ordinarily will be treated as "hidden" by the file system, the frontend canister will need to be configured to upload your document. To configure the frontend canister, create a new file, `.ic-assets.json`. `.ic-assets.json` needs to be placed inside a directory listed in `sources` for your canister, so you can use `src/assets` again. Your new list of files should look like this:

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
├── dfx.json
├── package.json
├── src
│   ├── project_frontend
│   │   ├── src
│   │   │   ├── .ic-assets.json
│   │   │   ├── .well-known
│   │   │   │   └── ii-alternative-origins

```

Then, configure the `.well-known` directory to be included with:

src/project\_frontend/src/.ic-assets.json

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
[\
  {\
    "match": ".well-known",\
    "ignore": false\
  },\
  {\
    "match": ".well-known/ii-alternative-origins",\
    "headers": {\
      "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*",\
      "Content-Type": "application/json"\
    },\
    "ignore": false\
  }\
]

```

This includes a general rule to not ignore the `.well-known` directory and rules to deliver the `ii-alternative-origins` with access control and content-type headers.

Then, all you need to do is deploy your canister. When you attempt to authenticate from origin **B** from then on, you will get back the same principal you get while using **A**. This needs to be supplemented with the information configured with the `AuthClient` to specifically request to use domain **A** when authenticating from **B**, i.e., set `derivationOrigin` in call options to `login`.
